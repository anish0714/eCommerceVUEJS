## Very impressive presentation, well articulated showing a good understanding of all underlying code.

## 69/75
## Remarks:
    A) A page that displays the 5 or more products (images and descriptions) that may be purchased in various quantities. This, and/or an optional product details page, should allow the user to select a quantity for purchase.
    ### Page with 2 records created with images and quantities. There is no way to add the products to cart from the products page. An optional product details page implemented.  
    B) A shopping cart page that shows the selected items and quantities of each user. This page should optionally allow the user to change quantities or remove items from the cart. This page should also allow the user to finalize their purchase.
    ### Optional element that allows users to complete purchase from cart page implemented
    C) An account creation/editing page where the user can create a new account or modify current details. This page should at least collect/update the user's shipping address. Other optional behavior could include password change. Optionally, account creation should be at the discretion of the user, so they may purchase anonymously.
    ### account creation functionality implemented. Optional functionality to allow purchases without logging in not implemented.
    D) A comments page where purchasers with accounts may rate and comment on products they have purchased with their account information. They may optionally upload photos as well as enter comment text. This page should also display comments from others to the current user before and after the purchase.
    ### comments page not implemented.
    E) A login element on every page that shows the user a login dialog for switching from anonymous shopping. The element should optionally switch to showing the user's name when logged in.
    ### This is done.
